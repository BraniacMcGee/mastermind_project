Want to be mostly if not completely finished by Monday night
so we're not panicking Tuesday night


#Project outline:
first put =
Welcome to MASTERMIND

Would you like to (p)lay, read the (i)nstructions, or (q)uit?

==>
p for play
i for instructions
q for quit

second put =
I have generated a beginner sequence with four elements made up of: (r)ed,
(g)reen, (b)lue, and (y)ellow. Use (q)uit at any time to end the game.
What's your guess?

Guesses are case insensitive
If it’s 'q' or 'quit' then exit the game
If it’s 'c' or 'cheat' then print out the current secret code
If it’s fewer than four letters, tell them it’s too short
If it’s longer than four letters, tell them it’s too long
If they guess the secret sequence, enter the end game flow below
Otherwise give them feedback on the guess like this

final output =
Congratulations! You guessed the sequence 'GRRB' in 8 guesses over 4 minutes,
22 seconds.

Do you want to (p)lay again or (q)uit?
If they enter 'p' or 'play' then restart the game. 'q' or 'quit' ends the game.

first step: develope the secret message (randomized through a bank of possibilities)

RRGB
BBRG no correct locations 3 correct letters
